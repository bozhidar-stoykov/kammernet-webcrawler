# kammernet-webcrawler

This is a simple web crawler for the website Kammernet that I made whille looking for accomodation.

Kammernet is a website that offers rooms and apartments for rent in the Netherlands.
Due to having really bad, or sometimes missing, filters I made this web crawler to speed up my searches and 
filter out the accomodations that didn't fit my criterea, or I didn't fit the requirements (based on sex or spoken language).

### How to use:
After running the program, you need to enter in the following order:
- The name of the city where you want to find accomodation.
- Your sex (`Man` or `Vrouw`) - Vrouw is woman in Dutch.
- The maximum price you are willig to pay per month in euro.
- The minimum surface area of the room/apartment.
- If you want Gas, Water and Electricity to be included in the price, answer with `Yes` or `No`

After filling the last field the program will go to the kammernet website and find all the properties that meet your criterea.
